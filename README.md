# LINEAR EQUATION TEST with a Python Script ‚ûï‚ûñ‚ûïüêçüêçüêç

### Overview

The project provides a Python-based tool to test your knowledge and understanding of simple linear equations. This guide will help you set up and run the linear equation test on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following are installed:

- **Python 3.13**

### Installation Steps

1. Install Python 3.x

   - Windows: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) 
   - macOS: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)

   After downloading, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to tick the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### How to Run This Test üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
- Run the script by typing:

```bash
python3 linear_equation_test.py
```

You should have the following tkinter GUI pop up:

- Windows:

<br />

- macOS:

<br />

   To save duplicating information moving forward the guide will concentrate on the mac version of the GUI but every action is the same in the Windows version.

  
To begin click on the `Start Test` button or hit the Return key:

## Technical Documentation

### Project Structure

```
IFCS1-LT-Sum1/Summative-1-Task-1/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ linear_equation_test_app.py        # Main script for linear equation test app
```

### linear_equation_test_app.py

This script creates a simple GUI-based test for solving basic linear equations using the tkinter module. It includes:

A DPI-awareness function for improved display scaling on Windows.

A main application class ```LinearEquationTest``` that initialises and displays the test window.

A Test frame class that manages question generation, input validation, scoring, and user feedback.

### Key Features:

### DPI Support
A helper function `set_dpi_awareness()` ensures clear visuals on high-resolution screens.

### GUI Construction with Tkinter
The application window is built using `tkinter.Tk`, and UI components (labels, buttons, entries) are arranged with grid layout.

### Linear Equation Quiz
Questions are randomly generated in one of three formats:<br />
`ax = b`<br />
`ax + c = b`<br />
`ax - c = b`<br />
The user is prompted to solve for `x`.

### Test Control
The user can start# the test with a button or by pressing the Enter key. Answers are checked for correctness, and feedback is shown with emojis for encouragement.

### Scoring System
Each correct answer increases the score, and the final percentage is displayed when the test is complete.

### Error Handling
The `check_answer()` method uses a `try/except` block to catch and handle invalid input (non-numeric answers).

### Example Flow:

1 - Launch the app.<br /><br />
2 - Click "Start Test" to begin.<br /><br />
3 - Solve the equation shown.<br /><br />
4 - Enter the answer rounded to two decimal places.<br /><br />
5 - Receive feedback and see progress.<br /><br />
6 - Final results are shown after completing the set number of questions (default: 5).

### Dependencies

- The script uses only Python‚Äôs built-in libraries: `tkinter` and `random`.
- No external packages or installations are required.
