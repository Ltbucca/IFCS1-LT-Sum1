# LINEAR EQUATION TEST with a Python Script ➕➖➕🐍🐍🐍

### Overview

The project provides a Python-based tool to test your knowledge and understanding of simple linear equations. This guide will help you set up and run the linear equation test on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following are installed:

- **Python 3.13**

### Installation Steps

1. Install Python 3.x

   - Windows: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - macOS: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)

   After downloading, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to tick the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### How to Run This Test 🏃‍♂🏃‍♂🏃‍♂

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
- Run the script by typing:

```bash
python3 linear_equation_test.py
```

You should have the following tkinter GUI pop up:
